# speckles
Study the temporal behavior of atmospheric PSF parameters by leveraging datasets of fast speckle images – series of 1000 images of stars with 60-ms exposure times, with high spatial resolution – taken with the Differential Speckle Survey Instrument (DSSI) at Cerro Pachon.

Code lives in named directory, saving fit parameters to Fits/ and plots to Plots/Results. No demo notebooks at the moment.
